1. Create a new subdirectory in your home directory, say hw5.

2. Inside the hw5 directory, have two files: 
   - README: Its first line should have EACH team member's
     name and student id, e.g.
       
       John Doe, 888888888
       Jane Roe, 999999999

   - hw5.pl: include all your code in hw5.pl 

   If your program does not fully work, turn in the last working part
   along with your attempt at the next part, and indicate clearly
   which is which in your README file.

3. cd into the hw5 directory (cd hw5).

4. Submit your files by running the commands:

      zip -r hw5 *
      handin cs140a hw5 hw5.zip

This will tar and zip all the files and subdirectories in your current
working directory and submit that file.  

The name "hw5" is a name the cs140a account uses for this assignment.
Be sure to use the exact name "hw5".

5. You can also use handin to make sure your zip file reaches the
   right place:

      handin cs140a hw5

6. If you want to submit your homework for a second time before the
   deadline, feel free to do so, but make sure you hand in everything
   each time. We will not grade you using two parts of two different
   submissions.

7. Remember to submit everything BEFORE the (firm) deadline. The
   homework is due at 11:59pm on Thursday, December 3, 2015. We WILL
   NOT accept late submissions.
