This program is hardcoded with 5 control points to create a Bezier curve.
To compile the program, type:
	
	g++ bezier.cpp -lglut -lGL -lGLU
	
I have provided an example data file called "data.txt" that contains 5 control points.
Each line in that document corresponds to x, y, and z values of a point, between world coordinates
of -200 to 200 in both the x and y directions.

To run the program, type:
	
	./a.out data.txt

				^
				|

			May be replaced with another
				file name later if you wish.

When the program is running, you may click and drag the control points (in black),
and at the ends of the curve. You must click within the 5x5 world coordinates box in order to 
select a point.

To write out the current values of the control points, right click and a menu will appear.
From there, simply select "Write Current Points to File." A file called "output.txt" will
appear in your current directory. This file can be read back into the program!
